# Stock Price Prediction

## Overview

This project is a **Stock Price Prediction Model** that uses machine learning techniques to analyze stock market data and forecast future prices. The model is implemented in Python using libraries such as TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

## Features

- Uses historical stock price data for predictions
- Implements machine learning techniques for forecasting
- Visualizes stock price trends
- Supports feature engineering for better accuracy

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing is available on **Kaggle**. Users must download the dataset manually and place it in the project directory.

### **Dataset Link**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jainilcoder/netflix-stock-price-prediction

## Installation

Install the essential libraries individually:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the project directory.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Final_STOCK_PRICE_PREDICTION_422P.ipynb`).
3. Run the cells step by step to train and test the model.
